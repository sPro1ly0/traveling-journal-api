## Summary

I like to travel but I have trouble remembering the details of what did during my trips. I would normally try to write down what did on random pieces of paper only to lose them over time. When I go hiking or have a carry on bag on a plane, I would like to bring a note book or journal along but I need to pack light so that I have enough room for food or other necessary items. I can take many pictures with my phone but I never go back to look at them often. I just pick a few pictures to post on Instagram with a caption of the place and forget about it. I decided to make the Traveling Journal to help me remember and reflect on what I do on my trips and to keep everything in one place.

The Traveling Journal allows users to write about the places they have been.
